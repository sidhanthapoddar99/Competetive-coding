Fredo and Array Update
Max. Marks: 100
Fredo is assigned a new task today. He is given an array A containing N integers. His task is to update all elements of array to some minimum value x , that is,  ;  such that sum of this new array is strictly greater than the sum of the initial array. Note that x should be as minimum as possible such that sum of the new array is greater than the sum of the initial array.

Input Format:
First line of input consists of an integer N denoting the number of elements in the array A.
Second line consists of N space separated integers denoting the array elements.

Output Format:
The only line of output consists of the value of x.

Input Constraints:


SAMPLE INPUT 
5
1 2 3 4 5
SAMPLE OUTPUT 
4
Explanation
Initial sum of array 
When we update all elements to 4, sum of array  which is greater than .
Note that if we had updated the array elements to 3,  which is not greater than . So, 4 is the minimum value to which array elements need to be updated.
